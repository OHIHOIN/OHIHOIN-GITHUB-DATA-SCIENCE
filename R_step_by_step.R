#' ## Assignment, Variables, and Data types.
#'
#' To store a value as variable `foo` in R the convention is to use the
#' `<-` operator, not `=`. This makes it easier to distinguish stand-alone
#' expressions from function arguments.

#+ assignment_operator
foo<-500;
bar<-foo;
bar<-foo<-500;
#' It's not a formal rule, it's rarely even written down, but `foo`, `baz`,
#' `bat`, etc. are throw-away variables people use for testing. If you need more
#' test variables, just make up three letter ones that start with `b`.
#' If you see one of those in a script you're reviewing it means it is left over
#' from when that code was being debugged. Example code shared with this class
#' will usually use `foo` and friends to represent the parts of an expression
#' that should be replaced with whatever values you are using instead of being
#' used literally. Shorter than having to write `YOURFUNCTIONHERE` or
#' `YOURARGUMENTHERE` each time.
#'
#' This is not specific to R-- it's just a little quirk of programming culture
#' in general. A quirk with a practical consequence: _never use `foo`, `bar`,
#' `baz`, `bat`, etc. in your production (i.e. finalized) code_ because
#' otherwise you or somebody else debugging your code will attempt to use those
#' names as test variables and in some situations this could overwrite the
#' existing variables!
#'
#'
#' ## Simple data types
#'
#' Numeric. You can do arithmetic on them: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `^`, `log()`,
#' `exp()`, `sqrt()`

#+ assignment_numeric
foo <- 2 + 2; foo;
foo <-log(10); foo;
whatisthis(bar)
#' Character strings. Create these by wrapping single (`'`) or double (`"`)
#' quotes around the value.

#+ assignment_string

#' Logical values are `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Can also be created using `>`, `<`,
#' `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`

#+ assignment_logical

#' Missing values are represented by `NA` (no quotes for any of these). Null
#' values are _not_ the same as missing and they are represented by `NULL`. In
#' some circumstances you might also run into `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN`. These
#' often indicate errors somewhere else in your code.

#' Dates and times. Can be created with the `Sys.Date()` or `Sys.time()`
#' functions or converted from a character string using `as.Date()`.

#+ assignment_datetime

#' Factors are basically integers that have labels. They are a human-readable
#' alternative to using integer codes for discrete data. These will make more
#' sense after we talk about vectors in the next section.

#+ factor_example

#+ assignment_wierd

#' ## Data structures
#'
#' Of course we usually need to work with variables bundled together, not single
#' values.
#'
#' ### Vectors
#'
#' The default data structure in R is a `vector`. You create one with the `c()`
#' command with any number of arguments. All items in a vector have to be the
#' same type.

#+ vectors_c

#' Since the default data structure in R is a `vector`, if you
#' create some sort of simple value you are creating a `vector` even if you are
#' not using `c()`... it just happens to be a `vector` of length 1. These
#' are identical, and both return `1` when used with the `length()` function.

#+ vectors_length1

#' If you want to create a sequence of consecutive integers, you can use the `:`
#' operator.

#+ vectors_sequence

#' In most other languages, you need to use a `for` loop in order to perform
#' some sort of change to a series of values. In R, you often don't have to
#' when you are working with vectors because a lot of functions (including all
#' the arithmetic and logical ones above) and be applied to a vector and they
#' work. If the function involves multiple vectors (e.g. `+`), usually you'll
#' want all of them to be either the same length or length 1.

#+ vectors_operators

#' You can assign names to some or all members of a vector when you create it.
#' You can also assign or re-assign names later using the `names()` function.

#+ vectors_names1

#' You can also use it to see the currently assigned names.

#+ vectors_names2

#' You can subset a vector by using `[...]` with the `...` replaced by _another_
#' vector, of integers indicating which positions you want to extract. Or you
#' could use a vector of names.

#+ vectors_subset1

#' If you just need a single value, use a single name or number.

#+ vectors_subset2

#' If you need a series of adjacent values, use `:`. If you need several
#' adjacent series with interruptions between them, use `c()` with `:`
#' expressions separated by commas `,`.

#+ vectors_subset3

#' Other useful functions for exploring vectors: `length()`, `summary()`,
#' `table()`, `head()`, `tail()`, `sum()`, `diff()`, `seq_along()`.

#+ vectors_explore

#' Here are some aggregation functions. For these, make sure to use `na.rm=T` if
#' your vector has `NA`s in it... `max()`, `min()`, `mean()`, `median()`,
#' `quantile()`.

#+ vectors_aggregate

#' ### Data Frames
#'
#' You can bundle several vectors of the same length together into a
#' `data.frame` using the `data.frame()` command. A `data.frame` is a tabular
#' data structure where the columns can be different types from each other
#' (though within each column the type will be uniform because each column is
#' still a vector). Most data in R is in the form of a `data.frame` or a class
#' that inherits from `data.frame`. The `dplyr` package makes working with
#' `data.frames` easier and a lot of attention will be devoted to `dplyr`
#' [below](#data-frames-indepth). For now, here are some basic commands for
#' exploring `data.frames`: `dim()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `names()` and (for
#' small datasets) `plot()`.
